<H1>ASM71</H1>
<H3>A Cross Assembler for the HP-71B </H3>
<HR SIZE="3">
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<p>ASM71 is a cross assembler for the HP-71B which is almost completely compatible to the
assembler of the HP-71B Forth/Assembler ROM. The assembler creates LIF compatible LEX- or BIN- files
which can be transferred to the HP-71B.
</p>

<H3>Requirements</H3>

<p>
You need a solution to transfer the LEX- or BIN-Files to a HP-71B. See the
<a href="http://www.jeffcalc.hp41.eu/hpil/" >PIL-Box project</a> for details.
</p>
  
<p>
The <i>Software Internal Design Specification for the HP-71B 
(Volume 1 and 2)</i> is needed as well. This documentation contains 
all information that is necessary to create assembler programs for the
HP-71B. The documents are contained in the documentation set that can be
obtained by the <a href="www.hpmuseum.org">Museum of HP Calculators</a>.
</p>

<H3>Usage</H3>
<P>
ASM71 <i>Source file</i>,<i>Object file</i>,<i>Listing file</i>,<i>Options</i>  
</p>
<P>
<i>Source file</i>: This file contains the HP-71B assembler source code. The
source file must be specified. If no file suffix is specified, '.asm' is used.
</p>

<P>
<i>Object file</i>: This is the name of the LIF compatible LEX or BIN file that
is created as the result of the assembly. If the name of the object file is omitted, the
filename is created of the name of the source file and the suffix '.lex' or'.bin'.
If any error occurs during assembly the object file is deleted.
</p>
<P>
<i>Listing file</i>: This file contains the listing of the source file, the compiled code,
diagnostics and a symbol reference table. If the name of the listing file is omitted,
then no listing and no reference table are created and the diagnostics are written to
standard output. The default suffix is '.lst'.
</p>
<P>
<i>Options</i>: An option consists of an option identifier (Letter) and a value (number).
All options and their identifiers and values must be contiguously specified without
any white spaces or colons.
</p>
<P>
<PRE> 
Identifier  Value     Description
---------------------------------------------
R           0         no symbol table
            1         symbol table (default)     
            2         symbol table with cross reference listing  
L           8-32767   number of lines per page (default: 63)                           
</PRE>
</p>
<P>
<H4>Examples</H4>
<P>
<i>asm71 prog</i>
</P>
<P>
Source file : <i>prog.asm</i>, object file : <i>prog.lex</i>, listing file :  (none)
</P>
<P>
<i>asm71 prog,,prog,R2L40</i>
<P>
Source file : <i>prog.asm</i>, object file : <i>prog.lex</i>, listing file : <i>prog.lst</i>  
</P>
<P>
<i>prog.lst</i> contains a symbol table with a cross reference listing and 40 lines per page.
</P>
<P>
<i>asm71 prog,test</i> 
</P>
<P>
Source file : <i>prog.asm</i>,  object file : <i>test.lex</i>, listing file :   (none)  
</P>
<H3>Assembler Source Code</H3>
<P>
The assembler source file must have the following form:  
<PRE>
<i>Output psuedo op</i>
...  
<i>Code</i>  
...  
<i>END</i>
</PRE>
The output pseudo-op must be either <i>LEX</i> or <i>BIN</i> to determine whether the output
will be a LEX- or a BIN-file. The pseudo-op <i>END</i> indicates the end of the source code.
</P>

<P>
The code portion of the source file consists of any number of text lines, each containing
one ore more of the following items: label, menmonic, modifier, pseudo-op, expression, comment.
</P>

<H4>Line format</H4>
<p>
The recommended column alignment for the assembler source code is:  
<PRE>
label    mnemonic  modifier  comment  
^        ^         ^         ^
1.       8.        15.       24. column  
</PRE>
</p>
<P>
However the assembler is "free format" and only the following requirements must be met:  
<UL>
<LI>labels must begin in column 1 or 2  </LI>
<LI>the other fields must be delimited by at least one space </LI>
</UL> 
The maximum length for labels and modifiers is 6 characters, the maximum length for modifiers is 50 characters.
</P>

<H4>Comments</H4>
<P>
Text that follows a complete instruction - a mnemonic and any required modifiers - is a comment. If 
the first non blank character in column 1 or 2 is a star then the entire line is a comment.
</p>

<H4>Labels</H4>
<P>
Labels can contain up to six characters. All alphanumeric characters are allowed except commas,
spaces and right parentheses. The first character cannot be a sharp (#), single quote('),
minus sign (-), left parenthesis, star (*) or the digits 0 through 9. The labels are case
sensitive! The restricted label 'FiLeNd' is reserved and must not be used in the source code.
The assembler has an internal table of the names and addresses of the 
<i>Supported Entry Points (HP-71B and HP-IL-Module)</i> and the <i>Fixed RAM-Locations</i>. These external symbols can be used in modifiers only
by applying a leading equal sign (=). It is not allowed to use labels with leading equal signs
in the label field.
</P>
<P>
Example:  
<PRE>
FNRTN1   EQU   #0F216
...  
GOVLNG   FNRTN1  
</PRE>
can be coded as:  
<PRE>
GOVLNG   =FNRTN1  
</PRE>
</P>

<H4>Expressions</H4>
<P>
Expressions can contain labels, the location counter value, constants and operators.
Any expression in parentheses can be nested within a larger expression. The level of
nesting is not limited.
</P>


<H5>Labels</H5>
<P>
Legal label names are described above. When the label is used within a larger expression, 
parentheses are required: <i>(XY-001)</i> is a label, but <i>XY-001</i> is an expression.  
</P>

<H5>Location Counter Value</H5>
<P>
A star (*) in an expression represents the value of the location counter at the beginning
of the current instructions. The value of the location counter is 0 at the beginning of the
assembly.
</p>

<H5>Constants</H5>

<p>
The numeric value of a constant can be expressed in decimal, hexadecimal or ASCII.:  
<UL>
<LI>Decimal constants can't exceed 1.048.575.<BR>Example:    12345 </LI> 
<LI>Hexadecimal constants must start with a sharp (#) and can't exceed FFFFF. Hexadecimal constants
are required with LCHEX and NIBHEX. Leading (#) is optional if hexadecimal constants are required.<BR>  
Example:   #F4D2  </LI>
<LI> ASCII constants must be enclosed within single quotes (') and can contain one or two characters.
ASCII constants are required with LCASC or NIBASC. With LCASC or NIBASC the length of the ASCII constant
can exceed 2 characters. <BR> 
Example:   'XY' 
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
  
<H5>Operators</H5>
<P>
There are seven operators listed below in the descending order of precedence:  
<table>
<tr>
<td align="center">- (unary minus)</td>
</tr>  
<tr>
<td>&amp; (logical AND)</td>
<td>! (logical OR)</td>
</tr>
<tr>  
<BR>
<td>* (Multiplication)</td>   
<TD>/ (integer Division)</td>
</tr>
<tr>  
<td>+ (Addition)</td>            
<td>- (Subtraction)</td>
</tr>
</table>
</P>

<H4>Assembler Mnemonics</H4>
<P>
The HP-71B Assembler Mnemonics are described in detail in the HP-71 Software IDS Band 1. Note that asm71 dos not support the following mnemonics:
<PRE>
D0=HEX hh  
D0=HEX hhhh  
D0=HEX hhhhh  
D1=HEX hh  
D1=HEX hhhh  
D1=HEX hhhhh  
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Note: the ASCII constant following the Mnemonic LCASC must be enclosed in single quotes (').
</P>

<H4>Control pseudo-ops</H4>
<P>
<PRE>
EJECT
</PRE>

</p>

<h4>Constant-Generating Pseudo-ops</h4>
<p>
<PRE>
BSS <i>expression</i>
</PRE>
Evaluate <i>expression</i> and generate that number of zero nibbles.
<PRE>
CON(i) <i>expression</i>
</PRE>
Evaluate <i>expression</i> and generate an absolute constant of length <i>i</i> nibbles,
1<=<i>i</i><=5.
<PRE>
NIBASC <i>'chars'</i>
</PRE> 
Generate the specified ASCII characters, with the two nibbles within each byte
reversed. The modifier field may specify up to eight characters.
<PRE>
NIBHEX <i>h....h</i>
</PRE>

<PRE>
REL(i) <i>expression</i>
</PRE>
Evaluate <i>expression</i> and generate a constant (relative to the current
location counter) of length <i>i</i> nibbles, 1<=<i>i</i><=5.
</P>

<H4>Macro expansion pseudo-ops for LEX files</h4>
<P>
These macros support the generation of LEX files. The macros expand to
pseudo-ops that generate the file header, the main- and the texttable.
</P>

<P>
<PRE>
LEX <i>'name'</i>
</PRE>
Assemble a new LEX file. This macro must be the first line in the source
file. The string <i>name</i> specifies the file name that is inserted 
in the LIF header of the LEX file. The string  <i>name</i> does not
specify the name of the object file that is generated by the assembler.
The LEX file will have the correct header. The initial data for this
file is defined by the <i>ID</i>, <i>MSG</i> and <i>POLL</i> macros,
which must be present in that order.
<PRE>
ID <i>byte</i>
</PRE>
Define the LEX ID of this LEX file. The <i>byte</i> is placed in the appropriate data
field.  
<PRE>
MSG <i>label</i>
</PRE>
Defines the beginning of this LEX file's message table. <i>MSG</i> will place
<i>label</i> in the appropriate field. If there is no message table, enter
<i>MSG 0</i>.  
<PRE>
POLL <i>label</i>
</PRE>
Defines the beginning of this LEX file's poll-handling-routine. <i>POLL</i> will place
<i>label</i> in the appropriate field. If there is no poll-handling-routine, enter
<i>POLL 0</i>.  
<PRE>
ENTRY <i>label</i>
</PRE>
Begin the definition of a <i>BASIC</i> keyword. Each keyword requires four pseudo-ops:
<i>ENTRY</i>, <i>CHAR</i>,<i>KEY</i> and <i>TOKEN</i>. Because of the structure of the
LEX file's keyword table, these pseudo-ops require a particular order. For example, the
following assembly language header defines two keywords, <i>KEY1</í> and <i>KEY2</i>.
</p>
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
ENTRY <i>label1</i>
</td>  
<td>The code for the first keyword begins at <i>label1</i>.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
CHAR  5
</td>
<td>
The first keyword is legal for keyboard execution and after <i>THEN .. ELSE</i>.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
ENTRY <i>label2</i>
</td>
<td>The code for the first keyword begins at <i>label1</i>.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
CHAR #F
</td>
<td>
The second keyword is a function.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
KEY  'KEY1'
</td>
<td>
The first keyword is invoked with <i>KEY1</i> in BASIC.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
TOKEN 1
</td>
<td>
The first keyword has token 1.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
TOKEN 2
</td>
<td>
The first keyword has token 2.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
ENDTXT
</td>
<td>
End of text table
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<PRE>
CHAR <i>h</i>
</PRE>
</i>
<P>
Describe the type of the BASIC keyford. Each <i>ENTRY</i> requires a corresponding
<i>CHAR</i>, which places a "characterization nibble" in the keyword tables. The
characterization nibble defines BASIC keywords as follows:
</P>

<PRE>
Value    Type of keyword
----------------------------------
1        Keyboard execution
4        Legal after <i>THEN .. ELSE</i>
8        Begin BASIC (legal as first keyword in a statement)
15       BASIC-function
</PRE>
<P>
Other values for the characterization nibble define combinations of the above types.
For example a characerization nibble of 5 defines a keyword that is legal for
keyboard execution and after <i>THEN .. ELSE</i>.
<PRE>
KEY <i>'name'</i>
</PRE>
Define the name that will evoke the keyword in BASIC. When there are multiple keywords in one LEX file,
the names of the keywords must be in alphabetic order. There is one exception: the name <i>'abc'</i> is 
not before the name <i>'abcd'</i>. If the first characters are the same the <i>longer</i> text must come
first. Otherwise the BASIC operating system will never find the longer keyword.
<PRE>
TOKEN <i>number</i>
</PRE>
Define the token number of the keyword most recently named (by <i>KEY</i>).
When there are multiple keywords in one LEX file, their token numbers
must be in ascending order. <i>TOKEN</i> places the token number in the keyword
tables.

<PRE>
ENDTXT
</PRE>
Mark the end of the keyword tables. This pseudo-op follows the <i>ENTRY</i>,
<i>CHAR</i>, <i>KEY</i> or <i>TOKEN</i>  pseudo-ops when a keyword is defined, or it marks
their absence if no keyword is defined.
</p>


<H4>Macro expansion pseudo-ops for BIN files</h4>
<P>
These macros support the generation of BIN files. The macros expand to
pseudo-ops that generate the file header and the subprogram chain.
</P>

<P>
<PRE>
BIN <i>'name'</i>
</PRE>
Assemble a new bin file. This macro must be the first line in the source
file. The string <i>name</i> specifies the file name that is inserted 
in the LIF header of the bin file. The string  <i>name</i> does not
specify the name of the object file that is generated by the assembler.
The user must create the sub header using the <i>CHAIN</i> pseudo-op.
<PRE>
CHAIN <i>label</i>
</PRE>
Create a 12-nibble subheader containing a subprogram and label chain. If
there are no subprograms, enter <i>CHAIN -1</i>.
</P>

<H3>Differences betweed asm71 and the assembler of the HP71-Forth/Assembler Rom </H3>
<UL>
<li>asm71 does not support FORTH primitives</li>
<li>The length of labels is limited to 6 characters. Extra characters raise a syntax error.</li>
<li>The filename in the LEX- and BIN- pseudo ops must be a valid LIF filename</li>
<li>Labels with a leading "=" cannot be used in label fields</li>
<li>Global  labels of the <i>Supported Entry Points (HP-71B and HP-IL module)</i> and the <i>RAM-Locations</i> can be used in the 
modifier filed with a leading "="</li>
<li>The depth of expressions in the modifier field is not limited</li>
<li>asm71 supports the generation of symbol cross reference listings</li>
<li>The B=B+A and D1=AS opcode opcode errors of the HP-71B Forth/Assembler rom have been fixed in asm71. The other known
rom errors do not apply to the asm71.</li>
</ul>

<H3>Format of the object file </H3>

<p>The LEX or BIN files are generated with a 32 byte LEX file header. The
following fields of the lex file header are initialized by asm71
(see: HP-IL Interface Owner's Manual, pp. 234):
</p>
<PRE>
Byte  Definition             initialized by asm71
