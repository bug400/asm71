About
=====
ASM71 is a cross assembler for the HP-71B which is almost completely compatible 
to the assembler of the HP-71B Forth/Assembler ROM. The assembler creates LIF 
compatible LEX- or BIN- files which can be transferred to the HP-71B.

See the doc/asm71.html file for more information about features and usage.

ASM71 was tested on LINUX, Windows 7 and MAC/OS.


Get Started
===========
To compile ASM71 you need the Free Pascal Compiler: http://www.freepascal.org
for the destination platform. See INSTALL for further details.
